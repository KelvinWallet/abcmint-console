# Kelvin Console for ABCMint

This project provides a wallet desktop application for ABCMint.

## Download

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/KelvinWallet/abcmint-console/releases)
page to download the latest version for Windows 10 and macOS.

## What is it

This is an software wallet implementation for ABCMint, the post-quantum fork of
Bitcoin that uses Rainbow signature scheme.

This wallet implementation derives your Rainbow private keys from a BIP-39
mnemonic sentence using a deterministic algorithm.  Thus you only need to
backup one secret mnemonic sentence just like how you would do for Bitcoin.

## Open Source

We are planning to open source the wallet implementation in the near future.
