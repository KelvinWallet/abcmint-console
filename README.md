# Kelvin Console for ABCMint

This project provides a wallet desktop application for ABCMint.

It derives private keys for the Rainbow digital signature scheme using a
deterministic algorithm to make it BIP-39 compatible.

Therefore you only need to backup your own secret mnemonic sentence just like
how you would do for Bitcoin.
